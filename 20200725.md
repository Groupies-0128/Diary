### Saturday

Today I've not studied well.

For modifying a frame work, I should begin with studying the paper.

For studying the paper, I should translate the paper first.

But I've played games the whole morning.

Tomorrow it won't be like today, I promise.

And I'll finish the translation at least.

 Off work, bye.
